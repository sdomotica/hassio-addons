# Integrate your Inim System into Home Assistant


## Inim
The evolution of the Inim species has a new name: Prime. A platform that has its roots in years of Inim experience and is projected into the future thanks to its cutting-edge features. Prime was born powerful and, as a result of its planned evolution, is bound to amaze. It meets all present-day needs and goes way beyond. It offers an unparalleled user experience in terms of simplicity, accuracy, ergonomics and reliability. It is destined to satisfy even the most demanding of installers who are on the lookout for a reactive and flexible system.

Prime was created to achieve a close integration between the functions of security and home-automation, thus generating a new concept of lifestyle and ease. A lifestyle that is not content with simply arming and disarming an intrusion-control system but that requires control of living spaces and comfort. A simple touch adjusts the intensity of the lighting in the living room or garden, activates garden sprinklers or closes roller blinds from no matter where you are, on the sofa at home or away on another continent. All through a single, simple tool: your smartphone or tablet.

Prime was born connected to the Internet and to the Inim Cloud with its infinite possibilities. Real-time control and management, push notifications for the user and the installer. And, additionally, for the Identified installer only, double personal-data storage capacity: gone is the risk of data and programming loss. Prime guarantees certified safety at the highest level. The system complies with grade 3 of EN50131 standard and with Grade ATS6 of EN50136: the highest rating also as an alarm communication system.

## PrimeLAN
Optional advanced IP connectivity module. It inserts directly into the main board of the Prime control panel and has a slot for a microSD-card. The PrimeLAN allows e-mail sending with a detailed message body for each individual event, complete with any "attachment" (contained in the microSD). The message can contain links to websites or IP devices such as an NVR or webcam. The presence of an integrated Web server, with “Alien” interface, allows control from a tablet, smartphone or PC via internet browser. The PrimeLAN manages interactive graphic maps that allow interaction with the system, by operating on complete floor plans and active icons for the management of all types of activation or command. JPEG and MJPEG streams from preset ONVIF webcams are also supported for video verification with the sending of e-mails complete with pre-event and post-event images. Management of orientable PTZ surveillance cameras is integrated. The PrimeLAN allows the integration of the Prime control panel with KNX systems.
