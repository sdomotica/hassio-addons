## Termogea
Termogea is a smart monitoring and control system for Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) plants. As a result of more than 5 years of research in the field of thermal and electronic systems, Termogea provides all necessary functions to maximize the efficiency and minimize consumption. It can handle the classical HVAC systems such as radiators and fan coils as well as more sophisticated radiant floor/ceiling panels and dehumidifiers.

All products of the Termogea product line provide remote control via smartphone app by default. They feature smart thermostat algorithms by learning the families habits and controlling the environment temperature and humidity accordingly. The automatic consumption analysis and notification of selected events allow the system to be most efficient.

Termogea is an innovative system based on Open Source technology which leads to continuous development of new functionality by its development community. Software updates are delivered directly to the connected devices each time an improvement has been released.

Furthermore, the integration with Cloud services allow for a customized system which is always up to date.

## User controls
A simple and stylish Touch Panel with an integrated temperature sensor can be installed in each zone for individual zone control and measurement. It allows to disable or enable a zone manually, change its temperature set point and, if needed, to select the season mode with a simple touch.

All touch panels are connected via a single bus (RS485/Modbus) to the controller device which makes installation very easy. Communication via a wired bus is recommended for new buildings as it requires cabling but it is the most reliable and secure option.
